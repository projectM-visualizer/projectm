done : 
	whitespace, unused globals, removed locals that shadowed globals
	made fullscreen a bool
	refactored eventhandler into a switch case
	put read_config into own header with a more descriptive name (getConfigFilename.cpp)
	done some include maintenance

Questions:
	Does anyone need the global `SDL_Surface screen` ?
	Is projectM-test the example projectM implementation?
		- create projectM-example 
		- use projectM-test for testing and debugging

Todo:
	projectM-test-texture, necessary?
		+ incorporate into projectm-test as an ifdef'd function
	projectM-test-memleak, necessary?
		+ incorporate into projectm-test as an ifdef'd function

any feedback, please come shout at fatray@users.sourceforge.net,
or leave messages of pure hate on the projectM forums.
