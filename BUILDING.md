# Building projectM from source

Suggested: use CMake. See [BUILDING-cmake.md](./BUILDING-cmake.md).

This document describes the deprecated GNU Autotools setup.

## Quick Start (Debian / Ubuntu)

For other operating systems (Windows/macOS), see the OS-specific sections below.

### Install the build tools and dependencies

Mandatory packages:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev mesa-common-dev libsdl2-dev libglm-dev
```

Optional packages for additional features:

```bash
sudo apt install qtbase5-dev # For building Qt-based UIs
sudo apt install llvm-dev # for using the experimental LLVM Jit
sudo apt install libvisual-0.4-dev # To build the libvisual plug-in
sudo apt install libjack-jackd2-dev # To build the JACK visualizer application
sudo apt install ninja # To build projectM with Ninja instead of make
```

### Download the projectM sources

If you want to use a stable version of projectM, download the latest release from
the [Releases page on GitHub](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/releases) and unpack it. You can then skip
to the next step.

If you prefer a bleeding-edge version or want to modify the code, clone the Git repository:

```bash
sudo apt install git # Probably already installed
git clone https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm.git /path/to/local/repo
cd /path/to/local/repo
git fetch --all --tags
```

### Build and install projectM

Older projectM releases use autoconf/automake for building. If your repository has a `CMakeLists.txt` file on the top
level, skip to the CMake part right below.

Replace `/usr/local` with your preferred installation prefix.

#### Configure the project using CMake

```bash
sudo apt install cmake
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
```

To generate Ninja scripts instead of Makefiles, add `-GNinja` to the above command.

#### Build and install

These commands will build projectM and install it to /usr/local or the configured installation prefix set in the step
before:

```bash
cmake --build . -- -j && sudo cmake --build . --target install 
```

**Note**: You won't need to use `sudo` if the install prefix is writeable by your non-privileged user.

#### Test projectM

If you have a desktop environment installed, you can now run `[prefix]/bin/projectMSDL`.

## Dependencies

Depending on the OS/distribution and packaging system, libraries might be split into separate packages with binaries and
development files. To build projectM, both binaries and development files need to be installed.

#### General build dependencies for all platforms:

* A working build toolchain.
* **OpenGL**: 3D graphics library. Used to render the visualizations.
* **GLES3**: OpenGL libraries for embedded systems, version 3. Required to build projectM on mobile devices, Raspberry
  Pi and Emscripten.
* [**glm**](https://github.com/g-truc/glm):  OpenGL Mathematics library. Optional, will use a bundled version with
  autotools or if not installed.
* [**SDL2**](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL): Simple Directmedia Layer. Version 2.0.5 or higher is required to build
  the standalone visualizer application (projectMSDL).
* [**LLVM**](https://llvm.org/): Low-Level Virtual Machine. Optional and **experimental**, used to speed up preset
  execution by leveraging the LLVM JIT compiler.

#### Only relevant for Linux distributions, FreeBSD and macOS:

* [**Qt5**](https://www.qt.io/): Qt cross-platform UI framework. Used to build the Pulseaudio and JACK visualizer
  applications. Requires the `Gui` and `OpenGL` component libraries/frameworks.
* [**Pulseaudio**](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/): Sound system for POSIX platforms. Required to
  build the Pulseaudio visualizer application.
* [**JACK**](https://jackaudio.org/): Real-time audio server. Required to build the JACK visualizer application.
* [**libvisual 0.4**](http://libvisual.org/): Audio visualization library with plug-in support. Required to build the
  projectM libvisual plug-in.
* [**CMake**](https://cmake.org/): Used to generate platform-specific build files.

### Only relevant for Windows:

* [**vcpkg**](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg): C++ Library Manager for Windows. Optional, but recommended to install
  the aforementioned library dependencies and/or using CMake to configure the build.
* [**NuGet**](https://www.nuget.org/): Dependency manager for .NET. Required to build the EyeTune app.
* [**GLEW**](http://glew.sourceforge.net/): The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library. Only required if using CMake to
  configure the build, the pre-created solutions use a bundled copy of GLEW.

## Building on Linux and macOS

### Installing dependencies

- Linux distributions will have packages available for most (if not all) required libraries. The package names and
  commands to install them vary widely between distributions (and even versions of the same distribution). Please refer
  to the documentation of your build OS on how to find and install the required libraries.
- On *BSD, install the appropriate Ports with `pkg install`.
- On macOS, using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is the recommended way of installing any dependencies not supplied by
  Xcode.

### Building with CMake

---

:exclamation: **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Currently, CMake build support is still in active development and considered
unfinished. It is working and produces running binaries, but there are still some features, build internals and whole
targets missing. While testing the CMake build files on any platform and feedback on this is strongly encouraged,
CMake-based builds should not yet be used in any production environment until this message is gone.

---

The steps documented below are a bare minimum quickstart guide on how to build and install the project. If you want to
configure the build to your needs, require more in-depth information about the build process and available tweaks, or on
how to use libprojectM in your own CMake-based projects, see [BUILDING-cmake.md](BUILDING-cmake.md).

Using CMake is the recommended and future-proof way of building projectM. CMake is a platform-independent tool that is
able to generate files for multiple build systems and toolsets while using only a single set of build instructions.
CMake support is still new and in development, but will replace the other project files (automake/autoconf scripts,
Visual Studio solutions and Xcode projects) in this repository once mature and stable.

Building the project with CMake requires two steps:

- Configure the build and generate project files.
- Build and install the project using the selected build tools.

**Note:** When building with CMake, the build directory should always be separate from the source directory. Generating
the build files directly inside the source tree is possible, but strongly discouraged. Using a subdirectory,
e.g. `cmake-build` inside the source directory is fine though.

This documentation only covers project-specific information. CMake is way too versatile and feature-rich to cover any
possible platform- and toolset-specific configuration details here. If you are not experienced in using CMake, please
first read the [official CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/) (at least
the [User Interaction Guide](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/user-interaction/index.html)) for basic usage
instructions.

#### Configure the build

Configuring a non-debug build with default options and install prefix (`/usr/local`) can be done with these commands,
building in a subdirectory inside the source directory:

```shell
cd /path/to/source
mkdir cmake-build
cd cmake-build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

CMake will check all required dependencies and display any errors. If configuration was successful, a summary of the
build configuration is printed and CMake should display a `Generating done` line. The project is now ready to build.

#### Compile and install the project

Depending on your generator choice, you can use your selected toolset as usual to build and install projectM:

- With `Unix Makefiles`, run `make && sudo make install`.
- With `Ninja`, run `ninja && sudo ninja install`.
- With `Xcode`, select the appropriate target and configuration in Xcode and build it, or `INSTALL` to install the
  project.

You can also use CMake's build mode to run the selected toolset and build any specified target. CMake knows which
command to call and which parameters to pass, so the syntax works on all platforms with all generators. If you've
already set the top-level build directory as working directory, simply pass `.` as `/path/to/build/dir`:

```shell
cmake --build /path/to/build/dir --config Release
sudo cmake --build /path/to/build/dir --config Release --target install
```

If you don't need root permissions to install running the second command without `sudo` is sufficient.

If you want to provide arguments directly to the toolset command, add `--` at the end of the CMake command line followed
by any additional arguments. CMake will pass these *unchanged and unchecked* to the subcommand:

```shell
cmake --build /path/to/build/dir --config Release -- -j 4
```

## Building on Windows

To build the projectM library and the SDL-based standalone application, CMake must be used to create the project files
first. Using vcpkg to pull in the build dependencies is highly recommended, as CMake can't use NuGet (NuGet pulls in
dependencies using the project files, while CMake requires the libraries before creating the project files).

#### Installing the dependencies with vcpkg

As stated above, using vcpkg is the easiest way to get the required dependencies. First,
install [vcpkg from GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) by following the official guide. Then install the
following packages for your desired architecture (called "triplet"):

- `glew`
- `sdl2`

The `glew` package will also pull in the `opengl` libraries.

Example to install the libraries for the x64 architecture, run from a Visual Studio command prompt:

```commandline
vcpkg install glew:x64-windows sdl2:x64-windows
```

#### Creating the Visual Studio solution

CMake provides separate generators for different Visual Studio versions. Newer CMake versions will support recent Visual
Studio releases, but may remove generators for older ones. To get a list of available generators from the command line,
use the `-G` switch without an argument. The CMake GUI will present you a dropdown list you can easily select from.

To set the build architecture in Visual Studio builds, use the `-A` switch and specify either `Win32` or `X64` as the
argument. If you want to build for both architectures, create separate build directories and configure them accordingly.

To make CMake aware of the installed vcpkg packages, simply use the provided toolchain file when configuring the
projectM build by
pointing [`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE.html) to it.

Here is a full command line example to create a Visual Studio 2019 solution for X64:

```commandline
cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A "X64" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="<path to vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -S "<path to source dir>" -B "<path to build dir>"
```

If you use the CMake GUI, check the "Specify toolchain file for cross-compiling" option in the first page of the
configuration assistant, then select the above `vcpkg.cmake` file on the second page.

Another option is to open the project folder in a recent Visual Studio version as a CMake project and configure CMake
using Visual Studio's JSON-based settings file.

#### Building the solution

To build the project, open the generated solution in Visual Studio and build it like any other solution. Each time the
CMake files are changed, Visual Studio will automatically regenerate the CMake build files and reload the solution
before continuing the build. Be aware that in old Visual Studio versions (2015 and earlier) the reload-and-continue
might not work properly.

You can also build the solution with msbuild via the command line, or use CMake's build wrapper to do that for you:

```commandline
cmake --build "<path to build dir>" --config Release
```

#### Using Ninja to build

The Ninja build system is shipped with Visual Studio since version 2019 and used by default if loading a CMake project
directly from within the IDE. Ninja can also be [installed separately](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases).

To configure the build directory for Ninja, pass `Ninja` or `Ninja Multi-Config` as the argument for the `-G` switch.
The difference between both generators is that the former uses `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to specify the configuration (
e.g. `Debug` or `Release`) while the latter supports all configurations in a single build directory, specified during
build time.

The architecture is determined from the toolset, so make sure to run the commands in the correct Visual Studio command
prompt, e.g. "Native Tools for X64".

Configure and build for a single-configuration Release build with vcpkg:

```commandline
cmake -G "Ninja" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="<path to vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -S "<path to source dir>" -B "<path to build dir>"
cmake --build "<path to build dir>"
```

Same, but using the multi-configuration generator:

```commandline
cmake -G "Ninja Multi-Config" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE="<path to vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake" -S "<path to source dir>" -B "<path to build dir>"
cmake --build "<path to build dir>" --config Release
```

## Notes on other platforms and features

### Raspberry Pi (and other embedded systems)

* projectM is arch-independent, although there are some SSE2 enhancements for x86
* [Notes on running on raspberry pi](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/issues/115)

### Build using NDK for Android

To build projectM using the Android SDK, please refer to the official NDK docs:

> https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cmake

It is highly recommended using the latest NDK and CMake >= 3.21 for building.

### LLVM JIT

There are some optimizations for parsing preset equations that leverage the LLVM JIT. You can try adding the CMake
option `-DENABLE_LLVM=ON` to enable them. They may not work with a newer version of
LLVM (https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/pull/360).

## libprojectM

`libprojectM` is the core library. It is made up of three sub-libraries:

#### Renderer

Made up of everything in `src/libprojectM/Renderer`. These files compose the `libRenderer` sub-library.

### Assets

`libprojectM` can either have a configuration hard-coded or load from a configuration file. It's up to each application
to decide how to load the config file. The config file can have paths defined specifying where to load fonts and presets
from.

You will want to install the config file and presets somewhere, and then define that path for the application you're
trying to build.
