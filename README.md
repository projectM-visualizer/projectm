## projectM - The most advanced open-source music visualizer

**Experience psychedelic and mesmerizing visuals by transforming music into equations that render into a limitless array
of user-contributed visualizations.**

projectM is an open-source project that reimplements the
esteemed [Winamp Milkdrop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MilkDrop) by Geiss in a more modern, cross-platform reusable
library.

Its purpose in life is to read an audio input and to produce mesmerizing visuals, detecting tempo, and rendering
advanced equations into a limitless array of user-contributed visualizations.

### Important: This repository only contains libprojectM for use in application development!

This repository now only contains the projectM shared/static library. All frontends, plug-ins and other tools were
outsourced into separate repositories. If you're not a developer and just look for a download to run projectM visuals on
your machine or device, please use one of the links listed below. The releases section in this repository only contains
source-code and binary releases of the projectM development libraries and headers, which aren't useful for end users.

### End-User Applications

**Important**: projectM is currently undergoing heavy development, so the available end-user frontends are either
outdated or unavailable. We've released a few development previews, which are not feature-complete and may have bugs. As
soon as we've finished the current modernization of libprojectM, we'll release new and tested versions of most of the
frontends listed below, while we may remove or replace some of those which are no longer maintained by their original
developers.

##### Windows

- Standalone (currently only available as
  a [development preview](https://github.com/kblaschke/frontend-sdl2/releases/tag/2.0-windows-pre3))
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358800/projectM_Music_Visualizer/) (Same as standalone development
  preview)
- [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NDCVH0VCWJN) (Old 3.1.12 release )

#### macOS

- Standalone (currently only available as
  a [development preview](https://github.com/kblaschke/frontend-sdl2/releases/tag/2.0-macos-pre1))
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358800/projectM_Music_Visualizer/) (Old 3.1.12 release)
- Music.app Plugin  (currently only available as an
  _unsigned_ [development preview](https://github.com/kblaschke/frontend-music-plug-in/releases/tag/v3.0-pre1))
- [Brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/projectm) (Old 3.1.12 release)

#### Linux

- Standalone (currently only available as
  a [development preview](https://github.com/kblaschke/frontend-sdl2/releases/tag/2.0-linux-pre2) for Ubuntu 22.04 and
  compatible distributions)
- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1358800/projectM_Music_Visualizer/) (Same as standalone development
  preview)

Or check your distribution's package manager for a binary release. If it is outdated, please contact the package
maintainer, as the projectM development team does not maintain any of the distribution-specific packages.

#### Android

- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psperl.prjM)

**Note**: Both the free and paid apps plus the Android TV app are _not_ created or supported by the projectM developers!
If you have technical troubles or other inquiries, please contact the app author via the means provided in the Play
Store. Any bug reports in the projectM issue tracker regarding the apps will be closed immediately.

- [ProjectM TV w/ Cream of the Crop](https://github.com/johnneerdael/projectm-android-tv)

**Note**: Fully free and open source implenmentation based on the original source code including Cream of the Pack is not made by projectM but is made available for your pleasure, later versions publisher to the play store might ask a small fee (that's definitely going to be cheaper then the current offerings)

#### Xbox / Windows Phone

- [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NDCVH0VCWJN) (Old 3.1.12 release)

#### Other

Source code and other resources, mostly aimed at developers.

- [Library source code](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/) (this repository)
- [Qt5](https://www.qt.io/) based [PulseAudio](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/) and JACK desktop
  apps [as source code for Linux](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/frontend-qt), currently broken and needs some
  updating (help wanted!).
- [ALSA, XMMS, Winamp, JACK](https://sourceforge.net/projects/projectm/files/) (legacy 2.x sources for historic
  purposes, unmaintained since 2012)

### Presets

The preset files define the visualizations via pixel shaders and Milkdrop-style equations and parameters.

The projectM library does not ship with any presets. The frontends come with varying preset packs which can be found in
separate repositories in the projectM repository list:

- [Base Milkdrop texture pack](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-milkdrop-texture-pack) - Recommended for
  use with _any_ preset pack!
- [Cream of the Crop Pack](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-cream-of-the-crop) - A collection of about 10K
  presets compiled by Jason Fletcher. Currently, projectM's default preset pack.
- [Classic projectM Presets](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-projectm-classic) - A bit over 4K presets
  shipped with previous versions of projectM.
- [Milkdrop 2 Presets](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-milkdrop-original) - The original preset
  collection shipped with Milkdrop and Winamp.
- [En D Presets](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-en-d) - About 50 presets created by "En D".

Included with projectM are the bltc201, Milkdrop 1 and 2, projectM, tryptonaut and yin collections. You can grab these
presets [here](http://spiegelmc.com/pub/projectm_presets.zip).

You can also download an enormous 130k+ presets from the MegaPack [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DlszoqMG-pc5v1Bo9x4NhemGPiwT-0pv/view) (4.08GB zipped, incl. textures).

## Architecture

- [Article](https://lwn.net/Articles/750152/)

# Building from source

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) and
the [developer documentation in the wiki](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/wiki/Building-libprojectM).

# Using the library

At its core projectM is a library, [libprojectM](src/libprojectM). This library is responsible for parsing presets,
analyzing audio PCM data with beat detection and FFT, applying the preset to the audio feature data and rendering the
resulting output with OpenGL. It can render to a dedicated OpenGL context or a texture.

To get started using projectM in your own projects, please go to the wiki and read
the [developer documentation](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/wiki#integrating-projectm-into-applications)
available there.

There are some open-source applications that make use of libprojectM which can be found in
the [projectM organization's repositories](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer) and elsewhere.

---

# Todo

- Improve projectM using the recently-released Milkdrop source (WIP).
- Update the various implementations using libprojectM.
- Update downstream projects with new versions.

please let us know! We gladly accept pull requests and issues.

Before starting to write code, please take your time to read
the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/wiki#contributing-to-projectm) in our
wiki.

## Package Maintainers

If you maintain packages of libprojectM, we are happy to work with you! Please note well:

- The main focus of this project is libprojectM. It's a library that only really depends on OpenGL. The other
  applications are more like examples and demos.
- Many of the frontend applications are likely outdated and of less utility than the core library. If you desire to use
  them or depend on them, please file an issue in the respective repository so we can help update them.
- The "canonical" application for actually viewing the visualizations is
  now [projectM-SDL](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/frontend-sdl2), based on libSDL2 because it supports audio
  input and is completely cross-platform.
- If you like Rust, there is a [SDL3 rust frontend](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/frontend-sdl-rust) in the works looking for contributors.
- This is an open source project! If you don't like something, feel free to contribute improvements!
- Yes, you are looking at the official version. This is not a fork.
